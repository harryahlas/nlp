# nlp
Code and processes for nlp work

* spacy_text_classification.py has good info on entities for topic discovery/modeling
* Next step would be to go back to the nlp tutorial and try to add entities for things like music equipment and band names.
  * Bonus if we can pull equipment and band names from elsewhere.
* train_textcat.py is from https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/examples/training/train_textcat.py
  * sneap_train_textcat.py has run with 7 possible classifications
